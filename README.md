## Notes for documentation updates

The documentation now uses the `awesome-pages` plugin which allows a
finer control of the document navigation. The official documentation for
`awesome-pages` is located in the [project repo](https://github.com/lukasgeiter/mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin)

In short, one may create a `.pages` file with in the directory hierarchy
to manipulate how the navigation structure is created. This file should
contain the `nav:` structure for just that directory. If the `.pages`
file does not exist then `mkdocs` will generate the navigate according
to its internal rules.
