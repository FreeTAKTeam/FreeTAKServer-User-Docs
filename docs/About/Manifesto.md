# Manifesto for FreeTAKTeam

We are FreeTAKTeam, a group of individuals passionate about democratizing Situational Awareness through the power of technology. 
We believe that access to situational awareness software should be available to everyone, regardless of their technical expertise or financial resources.
Our mission is to create open-source software that is user-friendly, intuitive, and based on the latest and most advanced technologies. 
We strive to make our software accessible to anyone who needs it, whether it be first responders, humanitarian aid workers, or military personnel.
We believe that by democratizing Situational Awareness, we can make the world a safer and more connected place. 
Our software is designed to be interoperable, allowing different organizations and agencies to share critical information in real-time, across multiple platforms and devices.

We are committed to constantly improving our software and keeping it up-to-date with the latest advances in technology. 
We believe in the power of community and welcome feedback, contributions, and collaboration from anyone who shares our vision.

Join us in our mission to democratize Situational Awareness and create a safer and more connected world. 
Together, we can make a difference.
