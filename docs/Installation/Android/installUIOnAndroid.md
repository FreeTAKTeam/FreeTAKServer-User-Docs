# FTS-UI Installation with Android
FTS-UI is installed with python's pip. One way to get pip on Android is with Pydroid3, available here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iiec.pydroid3

If you've installed Pydroid3 open the App and navigate to the terminal:
- In the upper right corner of Pydroid3, touch the 3 horizontal bars.
- Select "Terminal"
- Enter the following commands:
```
pip3 install FreeTAKServer-UI==0.1.6.5
pip3 install SQLAlchemy==1.3.23
pip3 install requests
pip3 install eventlet
pip3 show eventlet
```

After eventlet installs we need to update a file to hardcode the tcp/udp protocol numbers due to incompatiabilities with Android
- The output of `pip3 show eventlet` Location should be similar to `/data/user/0/ru.iiec.pydroid3/files/arm-linux-androideabi/lib/python3.8/site-packages`
- The file we need to update with the tcp/udp protocol numbers is located in `dns/rdtypes/IN/WKS.py`
- The full path of the file to edit using the eventlet Location output:
`/data/user/0/ru.iiec.pydroid3/files/arm-linux-androideabi/lib/python3.8/site-packages/dns/rdtypes/IN/WKS.py`

Now edit `WKS.py` and update as indicated below:

BEFORE:
```
_proto_tcp = socket.getprotobyname('tcp')
_proto_udp = socket.getprotobyname('udp')
```

AFTER: 
```
_proto_tcp = 6
_proto_udp = 17
```

FTS-UI `config.py` assumes a Linux environment, we need to update this for Android by replacing the appropriate paths with `/sdcard` for the following:
- `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`
- `certpath`
- If you are not running FTS and FTS-UI on the same device you will need to update `IP`
- The config file is located here: `/data/user/0/ru.iiec.pydroid3/files/arm-linux-androideabi/lib/python3.8/site-packages/FreeTAKServer-UI/config.py`

Now edit `config.py` and update as indicated below:

BEFORE:
```
    # This will connect to the FTS db
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'sqlite:///' + '/root/FTSDataBase.db'

    # certificates path
    certpath = "/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/FreeTAKServer/certs/"
```

AFTER:
```
    # This will connect to the FTS db
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'sqlite:///' + r'/sdcard/FTSDataBase.db'

    # certificates path
    certpath = "/sdcard/FreeTAKServer/certs/"

```

# Run FTS-UI
- Make sure your FTS is already up and running.
- From the pydroid3 terminal
```
FLASK_APP=/data/user/0/ru.iiec.pydroid3/files/arm-linux-androideabi/lib/python3.8/site-packages/FreeTAKServer-UI/run.py nohup python3 /data/user/0/ru.iiec.pydroid3/files/arm-linux-androideabi/lib/python3.8/site-packages/FreeTAKServer-UI/run.py
```

Now open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` and login with the default creds (admin/password)

# Troubleshooting
Error: `ImportError: cannot import name '_ColumnEntity' from 'sqlalchemy.orm.query'`
Solution: You didn't downgrade SQLAlchemy correctly

Error: `Protocol not found`
Solution: You didn't update `WKS.py` correctly

# Notes
* All testing was performed with a RPi4 8GB running LineageOS 18.1 32bit and Pydroid3
* These instructions assume you are running FTS and FTS-UI on the same device
* We downgrade SQLAlchemy because versions 1.4+ were not compatiable with SQLAlchemy-utils
* You need root access to update the tcp/udp protocol numbers (if you are using a RPi4 and LineageOS its trivial to enable)
