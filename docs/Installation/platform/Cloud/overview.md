6. For heavy production (50-100 Concurrent users) you may want to use 8 CPUS and 32 MB RAM

## Install FTS on the Cloud

You should now have an active SSH terminal on the cloud.

You can now install FTS using the [ZeroTouch-Installer](../../mechanism/Ansible/ZeroTouchInstall.md).
!!! tip
    You can probably accept the implicit IP address.
    However, setting the `--ip-addr` will not be wrong.

[Installation can also be done manually](../../mechanism/Manual/Installation.md),
but it is best to leave that until you have some experience.

## Getting Support

Support is provided on the FTS Discord server.
