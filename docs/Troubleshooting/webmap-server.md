# WebMap Installation

![image](../Installation/images/zero-touch-deply-default.png)

Some versions of the `Zero Touch Installer` do not install the compiled `webmap`.

In those cases you will need to install the [flow version](../administration/brokered/WebMap/Installation.md).

The WebMap is similar in function to `WebTAK`.


Web Team Awareness Kit (WebTAK)
: [A web-based interface which allows users to type in the website for a specific TAK server
(configured to support WebTAK) was recently developed.
The primary use of WebTAK is to provide quick access to data collected
in the TAK server to enable situational awareness to be shared and avoid having to install TAK clients
(i.e. `ATAK`, `WinTAK`, `iTAK`) on hardware.](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/tactical_awareness_kit_508.pdf)
