# REST API - Public

The FreeTAKServer REST API is a human readeble approach to the TAK world. The API allows you to easily connect third parties to the TAK family, without the need to understand the complexity of the COT structure or what a TCP connection is. FTS also supports an [Internal API](REST_API_InternalDoc.md).

## How FTS manages the information

FTS will send the  information coming trough the API to all the connected clients, addtionally it will save it to the persistency, to be query in future. 

## List of supported API

In the current release (1.9), FTS supports following API:

  * ManageAPI/getHelp
  * ManageGeoObject/postGeoObject
  * ManageGeoObject/putGeoObject
  * ManageGeoObject/getGeoObject
  * ManageGeoObject/getGeoObjectByZone
  * ManageEmergency/postEmergency
  * ManageEmergency/getEmergency
  * ManageEmergency/deleteEmergency 
  * ManageChat/postChatToAll
  * ManageRoute/postRoute
  * ManagePresence/postPresence
  * ManagePresence/putPresence 
  * ManageVideoStream/postVideoStream
  * Sensor/postDrone
  * Sensor/postSPI
  * /ManageKML/postKML
  
## General Configuration

> To quickly test the API, you can use a browser extension like ARC Advanced rest client (Chrome). REST APIs are easy to use, however they require a minimum ammount of knowledge, we DO NOT provide support to explain WHAT an API is. Please refer to an online tutorial such as [this](http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/using-http-apis-for-iot-beginners-guide/). 

### Endpoint

The API uses the following format:

```
VERB [Protocol]://IP:PORT/APIName/action
```

For example:

```
POST http://104.58.20.216:19023/manageGeoObject/postGeoObject
```

### Authorization

To use the API you need to have a REST API key.
The authorization is placed in the header of the message.

```
Authorization: Bearer [YOUR_API_KEY]
```

> You need to use the string 'Bearer' before YOUR_API_KEY

A valid key is generated from FTS' [CLI](https://github.com/FreeTAKTeam/FreeTAKServer-User-Docs/blob/main/docs/docs/CLI.md) or, since 1.4 also from the Web UI, and stored into the DB.

To add an API user in the CLI type:

```
add_api_user
```

See CLI help for details.
To create a REST API key using the Web UI, go to the User section and give an user a token..
Token: gives an unique combination that this user can leverage for the FTS REST API. NOTICE:  the field token is for any alphanumeric string. the prefix 'bearer' is NOT part of the token. The name â€œBearer authenticatio
To consume the API you will need to request a key to your FTS admin. 

The following is a non-working example of a key:

```json
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer meg@secre7apip@guesmeIfyouCan"
}
```

### Message

In most end points, the message is placed in the body of the request as JSON formatted. See below for detailed examples.
In the API using the *Get* verbs it's a variable.

## API Details

### manageGeoObject 

A GeoObject is an element place on a map. It has a name, characteristics, and an attitude.

#### postGeoObject

* verb: POST
* endPoint: /ManageGeoObject/postGeoObject
* returns: UID
 
##### Parameters

* GeoObject: It's the information that will determine which type will be placed on the tak maps including his icon. Please see API documentation for a list of valid entries. Since 1.7 you can also use nicknames for the geo objects.
* longitude: OPTIONAL the angular distance of the geoobject from the meridian of the greenwich, UK expressed in positive or negative float. (e.g -76.107.7998). Remember to set the display of your TAK in decimal coordinates, where *West 77.08* is equal to '-77.08' in the API.
* latitude: OPTIONAL the angular distance of the geoobject from the earths equator expressed in positive or negative float. (e.g 43.855682).
* how: the way in which this geo information has been acquired. Please see API documentation for a list of valid entries.
* attitude: OPTIONAL the kind of expected behavior of the GeoObject (e.g friendly, hostile, unknown). Please see API documentation for a list of valid entries.
* name: a string to ID the GeoObject on a map.
* bearing: OPTIONAL since 1.7, the direction expressed in degrees (1-360). Default: 0.
* distance: OPTIONAL since 1.7, the distance in meters from the Lat/long or address.
* timeout: OPTIONAL the length, expressed in seconds until the point will stale out. Default is 300 seconds or 5 minutes.
* uid: optional input parameter, need to be an Unique Id for this element, if not present will be  server generated, if sent ATAK will try to update an existing geoObject. Use `putGeoObject` instead
* address: OPTIONAL address of destination. If sent will try to solve the exact geolocation of the destination. Possible valid examples are:
     - Big Arkansas River Park, Wichita, KS, USA 
     - Wichita, KS, USA 
     - Big Arkansas River Park, Wichita
     - and so on.

#### postSPI

Creates an SPI at a point or update an existing SPI. If the video source is a UAV, and the UAV is also publishing its own position and sensor point of interest (SPI), those will  be plotted on the map. Being able to see the position of the aircraft and know where on the map the camera is looking in real time, while being able to see the video on the same screen, is a huge boost to SA.

 * verb: POST
 * endpoint: /Sensor/postSPI
 * returns: uid
 
##### parameters

* timeout: OPTIONAL the length, expressed in seconds until the point will stale out. Default is 300 seconds or 5 minutes.
* uid: OPTIONAL input parameter, needed to update existing SPI,
* longitude: the angular distance of the geoobject from the meridian of the greenwich, UK expressed in positive or negative float. (e.g -76.107.7998). Remember to set the display of your TAK in decimal coordinates, where *West 77.08* is equal to '-77.08' in the API.
* latitude: the angular distance of the geoobject from the earths equator expressed in positive or negative float. (e.g 43.855682).
* droneUid: the uid of the connected drone.
* name: the name of the drone, will become also the name of the video stream.
