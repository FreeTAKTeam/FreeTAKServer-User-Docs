# Update
in **certain cases**, if you already installed FTS with pip you can use
```shell
pip install FreeTAKServer[UI] --upgrade
```
this is **not** warranted to work with version 1.9.9, often the best way is to delete the installation  (saving first the data) and start from zero.
To remove your installation
```shell
sudo rm -r /usr/local/lib/python3.11/FreeTAKServer
```
