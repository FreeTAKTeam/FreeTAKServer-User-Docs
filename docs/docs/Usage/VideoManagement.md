# Video Management
Since version 1.9 FTS supports a complete video management function.
you can:
* Upload to FTS a video end point using the client (ATAK only)
* Download an existing video endpoint from FTS
* 
Additionally FTS will automatically send to all the connected clients video streams information coming from FreeTAK UAS or TAK ICU using the [API](https://github.com/FreeTAKTeam/FreeTAKServer-User-Docs/blob/main/docs/docs/API/REST_APIDoc.md#managevideostream)
