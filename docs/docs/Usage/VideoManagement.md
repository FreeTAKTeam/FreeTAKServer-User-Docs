# Video Management
Since version 1.9 FTS supports a complete video management function.
you can:
* Upload to FTS a video end point using the client (`ATAK` only)
* Download an existing video endpoint from FTS
 
Additionally, 
FTS will automatically send to all the connected clients 
video streams information coming from FreeTAK UAS or TAK ICU 
using the [API](../API/REST_API_Doc.md#managevideostream)
