### Donate Back
The FreeTAKTeam is working  daily on the development of an open and free solution.  We plan to do more than simply replicate the functionalities of the legacy TAK server.  Check out our road map [@FreeTakServer#25](https://github.com/FreeTAKTeam/FreeTakServer/issues/25) to see what is planned.  It includes a lot of cool ideas.

We are doing it for free, because we believe that donating personal time to a cause is an endeavour that is worthy per-se, however, part-time, we are also spending our own money to:

- Maintain a public server and a test server
- Investing in different technologies for R&D

If you feel that FTS is useful to you and you can donate in those challenging times, please consider sending a contribution here:

NOTE:
We are not a big fans of Paypal, but it is the easiest and most accessible way we have found for enabling some form of funding.
We hope to implement a more ethical system in the future.
