### Donate Back
The FreeTAKTeam is working daily developing an open solution. We plan to do more than just replicating the functionalities of the legacy TAK server. Check out our road map [@FreeTakServer#25](https://github.com/FreeTAKTeam/FreeTakServer/issues/25) to see what is currently in the works. It includes a lot of cool ideas.

We are doing it for free because we believe that donating personal time to a cause is an endeavor that is worthy per se, however, part-time, we are also funding resourses dedicate to:

- Maintaining public and testing servers
- Investing in different technologies for R&D

If you feel that FTS is valuable to you and you are able to donate in these challenging times, please consider sending a contribution: [DONATE](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=brothercorvo%40gmail.com&item_name=FreeTAKServer+R%26D&currency_code=CAD&source=url)

You can also support the project by buying one of our [T-Shirts](http://tee.pub/lic/elARpZYCmaw)

NOTE: We are not big fans of Paypal, but it is the easiest and most accessible way we have found for enabling some form of funding. We hope to implement a more ethical system in the future.
