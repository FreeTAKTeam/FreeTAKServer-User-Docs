# Introduction
FreeTAK UAS (FTUAS) is an Android application that can:

* Control any DJI drone supported by the current DJI SDK
* Stream the position of the drone to all the connected TAK clients
* Stream the video Feed to all the connected TAK clients
* Create a "target" on the map and stream with all the connected TAK clients

# Requirements

* [FreeTAKUAS app](https://github.com/FreeTAKTeam/FreeTAKUAS/releases/tag/1.4.14)
* DJI compatible drone
* FTS v 1.9 (or better): the application will NOT support the legacy TAK server.
* the FTS REST API service must be activated
* You have a valid REST Token (created in the FTS UI under System User) 
* FTH Video Service (or compatible RTMP server) if you want to stream live videos

# Installation

* Assuming that you have installed and configured your [FTS](https://freetakteam.github.io/FreeTAKServer-User-Docs/Installation/PyPi/Linux/Install.html) 
* and the  [video service](https://github.com/FreeTAKTeam/FreeTAKHub/blob/main/README.md), 
* download the [APK installation file](https://github.com/niccellular/FreeTAKUAS/releases) on your phone / tablet and follow the instructions.
* if the installation is suvcessful you should have a new Icon

* start your drone
* start your controller
* connect the phone with FTUAS to the controller

* a popup will ask wich application you want to open
* select FTUAS and configure the following:
  * FTS IP and Port
  * Video Server IP and port
  * the Drone name
  * A series of messages will appear, indicating that the SDK is registred (requires an internet connection) and that the drone is ready
  * Now click on UAS [READY]

## Interface

the FTUAS interface is typical of DJI the following is special:

* As soon you switch to it  the drone will start streaming the camera
* As soon you switch to it the drone will share his position with the FTS server, that will foward to all the connected clients
* the "Red Dot" in the middle can be tappped to create a geoObject of type "Unknow" call target and send to all the connected clients 
* the vertical aim of the "Red Dot" can be changed by moving the gimbal
* in some model, it's also possible to aim the gimbal independent from the position of the drone by dragging the position on screen
* In the current version, the aim is not perfect so expect some delta

In alternative open the ATAK video player and search for the name of your drone

NOTICE: in the current version, every time a new video endpoint will be created, this must be manually deleted.
